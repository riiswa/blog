{"pages":[{"title":"Waris Radji, who am I ?","text":"Who Are You?My name is Waris Radji, I’m 19 years old, and I presently learning computer science at Université de Paris 13. I have been working at Laboratoire Scientifique de Paris Nord (LIPN - CNRS) as a Scala Developer to implement an unsupervised learning algorithm in the Clustering4Ever library. I’m also a high-level Street Lifting athlete in the Fundamental Strength Project (FSP) team. My goal is to become a doctor in Machine Learning. This is my first blog and I hope you will like it.Why Are You Blogging?I think that knowledge is some things that have to be shared to permit our entire community to evolve. As a very large consumer of blog posts, I feel I even have to share. The best way to know if you have understood a concept is to see if you can explain it.What Are You Going To Be Blogging About?Even if this blog will principally deal with Data Science, Procedural Generation and Programming (mainly in Scala, affirmative it is my favorite language), I would also talk about technology in general, sport (particularly on Street lifting with training methods and statistical analyses) and anything else that comes to mind.Who Are You Writing For?I write for anyone on this planet who has a sense of curiosity and a thirst for learning. I really hope to be able to facilitate beginner developers to be more advanced in their early days. If you feel you’re being targeted by my sentences above, I welcome you!How Can They Get Involved?I am open to all constructive comments, especially in my writing, as I am just starting out. Anyone who desires to write an article on my blog is welcome and feel free to recommend new topics. We’ll all move forward together!","link":"/about/index.html"},{"title":"Projects","text":"A non-exhaustive list of open-source projects to which I have contributed.Clustering4EverA Big Data Clustering Library gathering clustering, unsupervized algorithms, and quality indices.GoSnake Scala.jsA simple reproduction of the snake game made with Scala.js library.GoBreak-Out Scala.jsA simple reproduction of the break-out game made with Scala.js library.GoThe Biggest Scala Cheat SheetA big (very big) cheat sheet on the basic notions of scala.GoAnt Colony SimulatorAn intelligent ant colony simulation that shows how ants search for food in their environmentsGoScalaMazeA little library that implement some procedural maze generation algorithm in Scala.Go","link":"/projects/index.html"}],"posts":[{"title":"Hello World ! Welcome to my first blog post !","text":"Welcome to the launch of my new and 1st website! My name is Waris Radji and I’m so excited to share with you my knowledge!

But to summarize, I will mainly write articles about my passions, Scala programming, Data Science and Street Lifting to cite some examples.How can I get involved?Feel free to take part in my journey by suggesting ideas for articles and even writing articles on my blog yourself, it will be a pleasure! Comments, donations, and sharing are also welcome!How can I be informed?To keep you informed of my future posts I invite you to follow me on my social networks (on the left) and even better on my newsletter (on the right) where you’ll be informed each week of my latest posts.
