Scala has a very rich and complete [collection library](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/overview.html). Each collection has its own properties, that's why I designed a flow-chart that will allow you to easily find the collection that fits your needs. You can visit the [Interactive page](/scala-collection-flow-chart.html) or just click on the following image:

Feel free to contact me to correct or improve this chart.
